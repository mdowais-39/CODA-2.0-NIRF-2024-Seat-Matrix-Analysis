## üöÄ Project Overview

**CODA 2.0** is a data-driven exploration aimed at uncovering disparities in India's higher education system. By analyzing the **NIRF 2024 Seat Matrix** data, this project identifies states with potentially weaker education infrastructure and opportunities. The core insight? Higher mean closing ranks in college admissions often signal lower competition, which could indicate limited access to quality education, fewer prestigious institutions, or underdeveloped opportunities.

This analysis empowers policymakers, educators, and students to spotlight regions needing urgent improvements for equitable growth.

**Key Question:** Which states have the weakest education systems based on admission trends?

---

## üéØ Objectives

- **Identify Weak Spots:** Pinpoint states like Sikkim, Manipur, and Mizoram with higher mean closing ranks, suggesting lower education quality or desirability.
- **Highlight Strengths:** Recognize competitive states such as Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu with lower closing ranks, indicating robust education ecosystems.
- **Drive Action:** Provide data-backed recommendations for governments to upgrade policies, infrastructure, and opportunities in underperforming states.

---

## üìä Data Sources

- **Primary Dataset:** `2024_Seat_Matrix.csv` ‚Äì Contains details on institute names, programs, seat pools, reservations (OPEN, SC, ST, etc.), and total seats across India.
- **Additional Context:** References to JoSAA Round 5 data for closing ranks (integrated in the analysis).
- **Scope:** All India seats from IITs, NITs, IIITs, and other central universities.

**Note:** Data is sourced from official NIRF/JoSAA releases. Ensure you have the CSV file in your working directory.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

1. **Data Loading & Preparation:**
   - Import libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
   - Load the seat matrix CSV and perform basic EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) ‚Äì describe data, check for nulls, and visualize distributions.

2. **Analysis Steps:**
   - Group data by states/institutes.
   - Calculate mean closing ranks (from Round 5 integrations).
   - Visualize trends using bar plots, heatmaps, and scatter plots for seat distribution vs. ranks.
   - Compare categories: Gender-neutral vs. Female-only seats, reservation impacts.

3. **Key Metrics:**
   - **Mean Closing Rank:** Higher values indicate easier admissions (potentially weaker demand/quality).
   - **Seat Availability:** Total seats per state/program.
   - **Reservation Breakdown:** OPEN, EWS, SC, ST, OBC distributions.

4. **Tools Used:**
   - Python 3.12 in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Visualizations: Seaborn for heatmaps, Matplotlib for plots.

## üîç Key Findings

- **Underperforming States:**  
  Sikkim, Manipur, and Mizoram show **higher mean closing ranks**, pointing to:  
  - Limited high-quality institutions.  
  - Lower student competition.  
  - Potential gaps in education infrastructure and opportunities.

- **Top-Performing States:**  
  Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu exhibit **lower closing ranks**, reflecting:  
  - Strong education systems with prestigious colleges.  
  - High competition and better opportunities.

- **Visual Insights:**  
  (Refer to the notebook for plots)  
  - Bar chart: Mean Closing Ranks by State.  
  - Pie chart: Seat Distribution Across Categories.  

**Conclusion:** States with higher ranks need targeted investments in education policies, faculty, and infrastructure to foster growth and competition. This could bridge the gap and elevate national education standards!
